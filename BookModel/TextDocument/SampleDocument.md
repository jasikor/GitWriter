abstract:

  We discussed **programming _concepts_** related to the C# language, including keywords,
  syntax, and semantics. We started by exploring the concept of keywords and their
  importance in defining the [**syntax** and **semantics**](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=computer+programming "syntax and semantics") of a programming language. We then
  looked at the specific uses of the public and private keywords in C#, including their role
  in encapsulation, information hiding, and testability.

  Finally, we discussed the meaning of syntax and semantics in computer programming,
  highlighting how syntax defines the structure and grammar of a language, while
  semantics describe the meaning and behavior of a program.

  * public

  * private

  * if

  * void

  * class

notes:

  We discussed several keywords related to C# programming, including:

  * **public** and **private**.

    We talked about how the **public** keyword can be used to make a member of a 
    class accessible from outside the class, while the private keyword can be used to 
    hide members of a class from outside access. 

  * We also mentioned other C# keywords in passing, such as class, void, and int,
    which are used to define classes, methods, and data types in the language.

# C# Keywords

## Why we need keywords?

Keywords are an **essential** part of any programming language, including C#.
Keywords provide a way for programmers to write code that follows the syntax rules
of the language. Keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning within
the language, and using them correctly helps ensure that the code is written in a
way that the compiler can understand and execute.

Keywords also have a specific meaning within the language, and they help convey
the intent of the code to other programmers who might read or work with the code
later. For example, if you use the public keyword in C#, other programmers who
read your code will know that the field, property, or method that it is applied to 
can be accessed from outside of the class.

### Syntax

In  [computer programming](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=computer+programming "computer programming")
, syntax refers to the set of rules that define how a programming language must
be structured in order for the code to be considered valid and executable by the
computer. In other words, syntax defines the correct way to write code in a
programming language.

### Semantics

In computer programming, semantics refers to the meaning or interpretation of a
program, rather than its syntax. While syntax defines the structure and grammar
of a programming language, semantics define what the code actually does when it
is executed by the computer.

## 5 C# keywords

Here are five C# keywords:

* **public**: A keyword used to specify that a class member (such as a field, property,
  or method) is accessible from outside the class.

  In C#, public is an access modifier keyword that is used to specify the
  accessibility level of a member of a class. Specifically, when you mark a class
  member (such as a field, property, or method) with the public keyword, you are
  indicating that the member can be accessed from outside of the class in which it
  is defined.

* **private**: A keyword used to specify that a class member is accessible only within
  the class itself.

    * _Encapsulation_: One of the main uses of the private keyword is to encapsulate
      the internal state of a class. By marking fields and methods as private, you
      can restrict access to those members to within the class itself. This helps
      prevent other parts of the code from directly modifying the internal state of
      the class, which can improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.

    * _Information hiding_: Another use of the private keyword is to hide implementation
      details from other parts of the code. By marking certain members as private, you
      can ensure that only the class itself knows how those members are implemented.
      This can help make the code more secure, as well as more flexible and adaptable
      to changes in the future.

    * _Testability_: Finally, the private keyword can be useful for writing tests for
      your code. By marking certain members as private, you can ensure that they are
      not directly accessible from outside of the class.

      This can make it easier to test individual parts of the code in isolation,
      which can improve the reliability and robustness of your tests.

* **class**: A keyword used to define a new class.

* **if**: A keyword used to start a conditional statement that executes code only if
  a certain condition is true.

* **for**: A keyword used to start a loop that repeats a block of code a specified
  number of times.
